## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Setting up an AWS Account**
2. **Uploading Data to Amazon S3**
3. **Building a Data Catalog with AWS Glue**
4. **Querying Data with AWS Athena**
5. **Creating and Testing Lambda Functions using AWS Wrangler**
6. **Building ETL Pipelines**
7. **Visualizing Data with AWS QuickSight**
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- AWS CLI installed
- Basic knowledge of AWS services (S3, Glue, Athena, Lambda)
- Familiarity with Python and SQL

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YouTube-Data-Analysis.git
   cd YouTube-Data-Analysis

## Project Steps
### 1. Setting up an AWS Account
- Create an AWS account.
- Secure the root account with a strong password.
- Set up IAM roles and users with appropriate permissions.
### 2. Uploading Data to Amazon S3
- Create an S3 bucket to store your data.
Use the AWS CLI to upload data to the S3 bucket:
aws s3 cp path_to_your_data s3://your_bucket_name --recursive
### 3. Building a Data Catalog with AWS Glue
Create a Glue Crawler to crawl your S3 bucket and build a data catalog.
Define the IAM role for Glue and grant it access to your S3 bucket.
Run the crawler to catalog your data.
### 4. Querying Data with AWS Athena
Use AWS Athena to create tables and query your data.
Handle JSON serialization and deserialization issues by pre-processing the data.
### 5. Creating and Testing Lambda Functions
Create a Lambda function to process data.
Use AWS Wrangler to access and manipulate files in the S3 bucket.
Store processed data in Parquet format in the S3 bucket.
### 6. Building ETL Pipelines
Create an ETL job using AWS Glue to transform and clean data.
Use Glue to move data from the raw bucket to a clean bucket.
Create partitions and dynamic data frames for efficient querying.
### 7. Visualizing Data with AWS QuickSight
Create a data source in AWS QuickSight.
Build visualizations and dashboards to analyze YouTube data.
Share insights by publishing and sharing the dashboard.
## Challenges and Solutions
- Handling Big Data: Use appropriate AWS services to manage and process large datasets efficiently.
- Serialization and Deserialization Issues: Pre-process JSON data before querying in Athena.
- Error Handling in Lambda Functions: Ensure all required packages are included and handle errors gracefully.
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to YouTube data analysis using AWS services. By following a step-by-step methodology, we can derive valuable insights and improve video marketing strategies.
